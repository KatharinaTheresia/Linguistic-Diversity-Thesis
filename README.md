  Scripts for the hierarchical cluster analysis of digitization measures, organized by year (2004‚Äì2023).

- **`correlation_analysis/`**  
  Scripts for year-by-year (2004-2023) correlation analyses between digitization indices and diversity measures. Subdivided by measure:
  - `entropy/`
  - `language_count/`
  - `RLI/` (Red List Index)

- **`breadth_analysis/`**  
  Script analyzing the conceptual breadth of each digitization index by year and in total (2004‚Äì2023).
